 Running the Frontend Locally
Follow the steps below to start the development server:

1. Open Command Prompt
cd <path-to-your-project-folder>
Replace <path-to-your-project-folder> with the actual path to your frontend project directory.

2. Start the Development Server

npm install   # Run this once to install dependencies
npm run dev
This will start the Vite development server and provide you with a local URL (usually http://localhost:5173).

 Make sure your backend API (e.g., http://localhost:5001) is also running to allow successful API communication.
